FlyAntiAirTurret
=============

Spigot plugin http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/fly-antiair-turret/ to shoot down people that fly in the server. NoCheatPlus is performace bugger and I need another approach.  
Banning is not an option, so killing might do. 

Commands:
---------
/turret <minHeight> - Activates the antiair turrets and shoots down players that have minHeight or more air blocks below them.

Permisssions:
-------------
By default all players have access to turret.fire - allows command turret
